<p><strong>New Composting Workshop!</strong><br>
</p>
<p> Our next workshop is entitled “Everything You Need to Know About Composting”. This informative workshop will be great for any gardener, whether you plant to invest in a commercial compost bin or simply start a compost pile in the corner of your garden. You will be amazed at how quickly you can produce rich, nutrient-filled compost with only little effort. Use this black gold to amend your soil naturally, to encourage the growth of healthy plants. Not only will you create rich soil and save water,- you will also reduce trash at the landfill by recycling your kitchen scraps and garden materials. </p>
